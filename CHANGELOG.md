### Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version, this version

a [new version here](https://snikket.org/service/resources/docker-compose.beta.yml).

Make a backup of your current docker-compose.yml if desired,
then put the new one in its place. For example:

```
mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.old.yml
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://snikket.org/service/resources/docker-compose.beta.yml
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```
